# Example project: instreamiterator1 
## _'How do I use the InStreamIterator?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'instreamiterator1\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how to use the unit operation TPbInStreamIterator for modifying input streams. 

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.  

Please notice that you need a valid Simusage installation to run the program. Please also notice that you need a "thermochemical data file" (.cst file) and a "Simusage stream definition file"(.ssd file) to run the model. These files can be constructed with the information supplied in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.

If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
