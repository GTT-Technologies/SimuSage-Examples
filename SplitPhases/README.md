# Example project: splitphases 
## _'How do I split a stream according to phases?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'splitphases\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how the unit operation TPbPhaseSplitter enables an ingoing stream to be split into several outgoing streams. The ingoing stream\'s content is split according to phases into the outgoing stream.  

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.  

Please notice that you need a valid Simusage installation to run the program. Please also notice that you need a "thermochemical data file" (.cst file) and a "Simusage stream definition file"(.ssd file) to run the model. These files can be constructed with the information supplied in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.

If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
