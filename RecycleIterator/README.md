# Example project: recycleiterator1 
## _'How do I use the RecycleIterator?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'recycleiterator1\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how to use the unit operation TPbRecycleIterator. TPbRecycleIterator is a component that enables the usage of recycling streams and is used to perform iterations on the part of the flowsheet that involves the recycling stream.  

In this project a simple case of such a recycling stream is demonstrated.

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.
