# Example project: optimization1 
## _'How do I use the Optimizer (PbOptimizer)?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'optimization1\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how use the TPbOptimizer component for the optimization of any process flowsheet build in __SimuSage__.

In this example, the total amount of gas is to be maximized between the temperature range of 400 to 600Â°C and amount range of 1 to 10 kg for a carbon input stream. As an additional limiting condition, a constraint is also defined, to guarantee that the produced gas contains a mole fraction of no more than 0.2 for carbon monoxide.

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.  

Please notice that you need a valid Simusage installation to run the program. Please also notice that you need a "thermochemical data file" (.cst file) and a "Simusage stream definition file"(.ssd file) to run the model. These files can be constructed with the information supplied in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.

If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
