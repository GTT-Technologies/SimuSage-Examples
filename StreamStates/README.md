# Example project: streamstates 
## _'How do I use stream states?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'streamstates\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how phases and phase constituents can be eliminated from an equilibrium calculation via so called "stream states" in __SimuSage__.  

In this example project it is shown how to assign and change stream states at design time and at run time in a __SimuSage__ project.

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.
