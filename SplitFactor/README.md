# Example project: splitfactor 
## _'How do I split a stream according to fractions?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'splitfactor\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how an ingoing stream can be split into two outgoing streams based on split factors.

Two kinds of split factors are demonstrated:
- A globar split factor, which can be set at design time and run time, splits all material of the ingoing stream with this same factor.
- A split factor which can be set programmatically on phase and constituent level at run time. 

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.
