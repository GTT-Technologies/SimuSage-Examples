# Example project: stream1 
## _'How do I modify the properties of streams?'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'stream1\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how the properties of streams can be modified at run time. 

It is furthermore shown 
- how support procedures can be used to display information about streams.
- how properties of streams can (or can not) be changed programmatically.
- how the __SimuSage__ exception handler can be used for reporting run time errors.

A detailed description of the nomenclature used in __SimuSage__ can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.
