# Example project: nomenclature 
## _'SimuSage Nomenclature'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'nomenclature\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate the nomenclature used in __SimuSage__.

The following concepts of __SimuSage__ are introduced in this example: 

- Streams (input streams, connecting streams, output streams)
- Unit operations (mixer, reactor, output unit)
- Linking (=connecting unit operations via streams)
- Stream types (= a list of phases which are permitted to be present in the stream)
- Materials (=description of the contents of a stream and its temperature)

A detailed description of the nomenclature used in __SimuSage__ can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__. 

Please notice that you need a valid Simusage installation to run the program. Please also notice that you need a "thermochemical data file" (.cst file) and a "Simusage stream definition file"(.ssd file) to run the model. These files can be constructed with the information supplied in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.

If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
