# SimuSage Examples

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example projects. They are intended to exemplarily demonstrate how to make use of __SimuSage\'s__ streams and unit operations.  

A detailed step by step guide to all example projects can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.  

Please notice that you need a valid Simusage installation to work on the models in development mode. You may, however, run the examples in demonstration mode, by using the light version of __SimuSage__ which is available with the released files.

If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
