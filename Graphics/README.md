# Example project: graphics1 
## _'How to display results graphically'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'graphics1\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how results (phase amounts, phase constituent amounts and system component amounts of streams) can be displayed in different graphs. 

It is also shown
- how this graph is automatically updated on demand, i.e. whenever the results it displays might have changed,
- and how one retrieves the desired values by iterating over all phases, phase constituents in a phase, and system components.

A detailed step by step guide to this example project can be found in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.  


If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
