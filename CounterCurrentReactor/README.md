## _'How to build a counter current reactor model in SimuSage'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'ccreactor\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how a simple counter current reactor model might be build in SimuSage.

It is further shown
- how temporary streams can be created and destroyed during run time.
- how the current state of a stream can be copied to a temporary stream.
