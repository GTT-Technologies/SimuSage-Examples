## _'How to build a counter current reactor model in SimuSage'_

The files in this repository correspond to the __SimuSage__ example project __\'ccreactor\'__. It is intended to exemplarily demonstrate how a simple counter current reactor model might be build in SimuSage.

It is further shown
- how temporary streams can be created and destroyed during run time.
- how the current state of a stream can be copied to a temporary stream. 

Please notice that you need a valid Simusage installation to run the program. Please also notice that you need a "thermochemical data file" (.cst file) and a "Simusage stream definition file"(.ssd file) to run the model. These files can be constructed with the information supplied in the __SimuSage V1 User\'s Manual__.

If you have access to __SimuSage__ and you need help please make contact with GTT-Technologies by email (info@gtt-technologies.de).
